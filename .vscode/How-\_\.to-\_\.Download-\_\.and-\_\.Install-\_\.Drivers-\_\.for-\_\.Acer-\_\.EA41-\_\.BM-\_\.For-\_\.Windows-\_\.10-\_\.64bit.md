Updating your drivers can improve your computer's performance, stability, and security. Updating your drivers can also fix any compatibility issues that may arise when you upgrade your operating system or install new hardware or software. Updating your drivers can also prevent potential problems that may cause your computer to crash, freeze, or malfunction.
